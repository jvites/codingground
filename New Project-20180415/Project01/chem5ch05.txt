Electric cars are being promoted as a way to address this situation by reducing the use of gasoline. Yet most electricity is produced by coal-fired power plants. Several factors need to be considered in determining whether electric cars actually are helpful in this regard. One is the environmental value of these fuels. Estimate the environmental value of coal compared to gasoline from the following information. The environmental value is defined as the amount of energy obtained per mole of carbon dioxide produced, so a larger environmental value is better.

SHORT ANSWER

	1.	Describe the difference between potential energy and kinetic energy, and give an example of each.

ANS:	
Potential energy is associated with the position of an object when a force is acting on it. For example, an apple in a tree has potential energy because it is being pulled down by the force of gravity and is being held up by the tree. Kinetic energy is associated with the motion of an object. For example, someone going downhill on a skateboard has kinetic energy.

	2.	Explain what is meant by the term state function, and give an example of something that is a state function and something that is not a state function.

ANS:	
A state function is a property of a system that depends only on the state of the system and does not depend on the path taken to reach that state. For example, the temperature of the room is a state function, but the cost of heating the room to that temperature is not a state function.
